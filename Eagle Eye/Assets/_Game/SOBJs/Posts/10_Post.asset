  Content: "Took some time off, but we\u2019re back with the reviews baby! Now, many
    of you asked my thoughts on the new Sons of The Wasteland album, and I\u2019ll
    just say this right now: it\u2019s NOT what you may be expecting from them. It\u2019s
    very different from their other releases, and it makes sense because this album
    is actually made for a game soundtrack! SODIUM is a 2D roguelike with fishing-based
    mechanics releasing later this winter, and surprisingly they were able to enroll
    a metal rock band into their sound design, just wow!!!"

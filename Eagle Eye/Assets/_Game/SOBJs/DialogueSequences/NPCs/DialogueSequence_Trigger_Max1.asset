  - "Sup Connor.\r"
  - Oh, hello Max. Leaving already?
  - "Yeah, thank God. I don\u2019t like being here so late, gives me the creeps."
  - "It\u2019s actually quite calm, very quiet. At least, until Rachel comes in.
    I think she\u2019s late."
  - Oh yeah about that. She sent me a text saying she would be late, problem with
    traffic it seems.
  - "So, you\u2019ll be working alone in the office until Rachel arrives. You ok
    with that?"
  - Sure, no problem. The rest of the team should be arriving soon.
  - "Cool, man. I\u2019ll be leaving now, so behave yourself alright? Anything happens
    you call me on your phone."
  - Have a good night, and a good shift.
  - Thanks, have a good rest man.
